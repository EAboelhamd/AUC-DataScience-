This Repo. contains practice on ML Algorithms for DS Course Students

There is no spesific order for working on each notebook .. however, it's recommended to start with the basic algorithms (i.e. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression) then for the advanced ones (i.e. KNN, Random Forest and then SVM)


Good Luck :)
