# AUC-DataScience-
- This Repo. contains practice on ML Algorithms for DS course students

- The implementation of all ML algorithms is performed using sklearn built in library in python .. 

You can read more about sklearn from the below link: 

https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

- There is no spesific order for working on each notebook .. however, it's recommended to start with the basic algorithms (i.e. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression) then for the advanced ones (i.e. KNN, Random Forest and then SVM)


Good Luck :)
